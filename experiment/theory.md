"Parts of speech" are the basic lexical categories of the words present in a language. It is very important to understand these, in order to understand the grammar and use of the language concerned.

Eg:

- Ram(Noun) ate(Verb) an(Determiner) apple(Noun) with(Preposition) a(Article) fork(Noun).
- राम(Noun) ने(Postposition) चम्मच(Noun) से(Postposition) मिठाई(Noun) खाई(Verb).


Each part of speech explains how the word is used. In fact, the same word can act as different parts of speechs depending on the context.

Eg: A noun in one sentence and an adjective in the next.

- The glass was broken(Verb).
- The broken(Adjective) glass pierced her flesh.

Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning a part-of-speech (lexical class marker) to each word in a corpus.
